# Videos Analysis website for real time videos and umploaded videos using streamlit frameworks 
the project is the one of the project for the videos analytics module in witch we use some classical methods to remove background in order to detect the moving object, or estimate the static or stationary background in a video sequence (Running average : moyenne glissante) Besides we use also some new approch to do so. and the file web.py was the finale version of the streamlit website that I coded and do this tasks. (i.e. The web.py is the final application).

### The App contain the following methods: ### 
    **Difference d'image** : detect the moving objects
    **DÃ©rivation temporelle** : detect the moving objects
    **filtre median** : detect the moving objects
    **filtre moyen** : detect the moving objects
    **moyenne glissante** : estimate the static or stationary background in a video sequence
    **Gaussian Mixture Model GMM** : detect the moving objects
